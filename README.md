# Gmail-Assistant


This is an openAI chatbot that works as a Gmail assistant. Users can ask anything about Gmail and even ask to write mail formally and informally to the assistant. To run this, you must add your openAI production key in the code and run it as a Python script. On the local host http://127.0.0.1:7860/ gradio library will display the Gmail assistant web app.
